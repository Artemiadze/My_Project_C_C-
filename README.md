## List of projects:

* "Console arkanoid"- a classic game with the reflection of the ball from the racket and the walls.
* ["Cellular automata. The game of Life](./docs/game_of_life.md) -  a cellular automaton invented by the English mathematician John Conway in 1970. This is a game without players, in which a person creates an initial state, and then only watches its development. In the game, you can create processes with Turing completeness, which allows you to implement any Turing machine.
* [The Ocean Game](./docs/Ocean.md) - The game follows a similar principle to cellular automata. The game features a full-fledged marine ecosystem consisting of fish, predators, top predators, reefs and rocks. For fish, predators and top predators, the main task is to survive and give as many offspring as possible.
* A program for working with matrices. Creates a matrix according to your request, creates a random matrix, can create a matrix of zeros or a single matrix on your command. The program supports the operations of adding a matrix with a number, a matrix with a matrix, multiplying a matrix with a number, a matrix with a matrix, subtracting a matrix from a matrix. The division operation is under development.
 
## Launching programs
All programs should be run in the console or console project in Visual Studio 2022 so that you can see all the features of the programs.
